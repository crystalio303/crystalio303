### Greetings!
I am a data analyst from the busy Northern Virginia. I use the regular suite of programs, Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau, PowerBI, GIT, and CSS/HTML. Talk of plants and environmental science tracked with data always interests me. If you are a non-bot human, interested in side projects or talking about how plants work, I would love to meet you here or on LinkedIn.
